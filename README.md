# Laser Absorption Spectroscopy ANalysis

## Introduction
This is a set of utilities meant to simplify the problem of analyzing laser absorption spectra. Its present development is determined by its use in measuring the absolute, line-integrated, densities of helium metastable atoms. It should also be able to analyze the temperature (via Doppler broadening), gas velocity (via Doppler shifts), and properly account for pressure broadening. While this is only a relatively simple profile analysis, it should be sufficiently accurate for basic diagnostics.

## Getting Started
I'll let you know once I've got some useful code up.
